# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server 🚀

## Overview 📚
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server is a versatile, modular server designed to handle multiple specialized context-aware tasks. Currently, this implementation includes MCPs for research and web scraping functionalities, making it an ideal foundation for projects requiring automated research or real-time web data extraction.

## Purpose & Motivation 🎯
In today's world, real-time data and reliable research are foundational to informed decision-making. This project provides a centralized, extensible platform to easily integrate specialized functionalities like:

- **Automated Research**: Quickly obtain summarized research findings tailored to recent developments and historical context.
- **Web Scraping**: Seamlessly scrape and process web data into structured, meaningful information.

The MCP Server offers flexibility, clarity, and expandability, allowing developers and researchers to integrate and scale additional MCP modules as per evolving project requirements.

## Features & Functionality ⚙️

### Modular Design 🔗
- Easy integration of new MCP modules.
- Each MCP module functions independently yet integrates smoothly within the central server.

### Specialized MCP Modules 🌐
- **ResearchMCP**: Provides real-time insights and summarized content related to the user's specified research queries. Incorporates a structured approach to verify and present findings from credible sources.
- **WebscrapingMCP**: Automates web data collection, extracting structured content quickly and effectively from specified websites.

### Logging & Debugging 📋
- Built-in comprehensive logging capabilities to track system events, debug effectively, and monitor MCP interactions.

### User-Friendly Interaction 🤖
- Interactive prompts in the terminal interface for switching MCP modes dynamically.
- Clear, detailed responses to user requests, enhancing usability and readability.

## Technical Stack 🛠️
- **Python**: Core implementation and logic.
- **Argparse**: Simplified command-line argument handling.
- **Logging**: For detailed logs and debugging information.
- **JSON**: Structured data handling and communication.

## Installation & Setup ⚡️
Follow these easy steps to set up the MCP server locally:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/praneethk-ai/praneeths_mcp_server.git
cd MCP_Server
```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the server:
```bash
python server.py
```

## Usage 🎮

Upon launching, the MCP Server initializes available protocols. You can dynamically select the MCP you wish to use:

- Switch to **Research MCP**:
```bash
RESEARCH
```

- Switch to **Webscraping MCP**:
```bash
WEBSCRAPING
```

- To exit:
```bash
exit
```

Interact with the server by specifying clear, descriptive requests, and receive structured responses for research and web scraping tasks.
